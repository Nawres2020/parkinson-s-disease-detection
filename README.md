# Parkinson's Disease Detection

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for detecting Parkinson's Disease using machine learning techniques. The notebook provides a step-by-step process, including:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance metrics and insights

The primary objective is to identify patterns and develop a robust model to predict Parkinson's Disease using available datasets.

## Key Features
- Clean and well-documented code for ease of understanding.
- Implementation of various machine learning algorithms.
- Clear visualization and analysis of results.
- Suitable for beginners and enthusiasts in machine learning and healthcare analytics.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn (and any other library used in the notebook)

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nawres2020/parkinsons-disease-detection.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the notebook to follow the analysis or test the models.
